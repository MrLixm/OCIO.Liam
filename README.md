# OCIO.Liam

Custom OCIO configurations I made for myself.

## What's interesting

### Versatile

[./versatile](./versatile)

A versatile (who would have guessed) OCIO v2 configuration for individual artists.

- working colorspace is `sRGB - linear`

- reference colorspace is `CIE-XYZ-D65`

### makeconfig

[./versatile/dev/python/makeconfig](./versatile/dev/python/makeconfig)

A custom python package to make creation of OCIO v2 configuration easier.
Like cooking a cake :)
